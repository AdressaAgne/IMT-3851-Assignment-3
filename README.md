OPPGAVEN :
You should submit a one page report along with the code explaining, how you organised the collaboration among team members (e.g., meetings!), and the reasoning behind your design, and implementation choices (database design, performance, security, frameworks etc.).

Programming for the Web II (IMT3851)

In our team, we have Agne √òdegaard, Audun Olsen and Minh Nguyen. 
Each member had different strength and weaknesses in the group, therefore we decided to divide the group into different roles that were suitable for each member. 

Agne was assigned as our team leader, due to reason that
he is very skilled with php. His focus was to build the backend on a homemade frame work.
Audun is our second in command, he wanted to get hands on with both javascript and php. 
Minh worked with the frontend, and had her hands on sass and pug. 

THE MEETINGS 
Our group managed to session three meetings, before completing the project. 
During our first meeting, we divided our group into different roles and task, and discussed about how we were supposed to put up the backend and implement our own framework. 
In our second and third meetings, we had long sessions. Meaning, we would execute the work together as a team. While using git as a collaborative tool. 

THE TOOLS
In order for us to complete this project with efficiency, everyone agreed on collaborating on GIT. Meaning each member could work remotely, and easily change the code without any fuss and just push up the new changes whenever we wanted. For our communication we used Messenger. 

THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES
Explain the reason behind :
the reasoning behind your design, and implementation choices (database design, performance, security, frameworks etc.).
